maintain list of points

calculate bounding box of all points

easy way to tell whether something goes infinite: is it the furthest point in one cardinal direction (or tied)?
    -can use bounding box to speed this up

Manhattan distance for (x,y) and (X,Y): Abs(x - X) + Abs (y - Y)

Iterating over every vertex in the bounding box... will be slow but doable?
